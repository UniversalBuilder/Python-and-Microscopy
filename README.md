# Python and Microscopy : what is it ?

This repository is a collection of  jupyter notebooks dedicated to microscopists wanting to use Python for their image processing needs.

It is also a way for me to keep all the examples I need in the same place, whether I plan to use them for teaching to others but also for learning since python is still new to me.

Most of the scripts are loosely based on the very nice series of videos by the *Python for Microscopists by Sreeni* channel at  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34rW-HtPJulxr5wp2Xa04w .
There are also scripts of my own, and I might also add other external examples if they are relevant to this topic.

Feel free to use these notebooks for any academic project.
