# Python and Microscopy
 Collection of  jupyter notebooks loosely based on the very nice videos by the *Python for Microscopists* channel at  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34rW-HtPJulxr5wp2Xa04w

The root of this repository contains all the notebooks and you will find data, images and results in the subfolders.

You will find here the list of all the availble notebooks:

| Notebook 	| Description 	| Direct Link 	|
|---------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Feature Bank Creation 	| *Create a DataFrame (the feature bank) where each column is a variation of a filter. To be used as material for machine learning training* 	| [Link](https://github.com/UniversalBuilder/Python-and-Microscopy/blob/master/Create%20a%20Gabor%20Filter%20Feature%20Bank%20for%20ML.ipynb) 	|
| Histogram-Based Segmentation 	| *Segment an image using its histogram. Find relevant values (valleys on the histogram) to determine the right number of segments* 	| [Link](https://github.com/UniversalBuilder/Python-and-Microscopy/blob/master/Histogram-based%20segmentation.ipynb) 	|
| Image Labeling using Histogram or Colormap 	| *Create a labeled image to be used later on in a machine learning context* 	| [Link](https://github.com/UniversalBuilder/Python-and-Microscopy/blob/master/Label%20an%20Image%20using%20a%20Colormap%20or%20based%20on%20an%20Histogram.ipynb) 	|
